-  I've always been curious about everything since I was little, I was loved reading and reasearching things :) I've always liked learning things and doing arts,
  and somehow computing found me and I'm so glad it did!
-  I´m part of a research project @ELLASNetwork, we work with open data, graphs and ontology. And our goal it´s to create an open data portal about women in STEM in Latin America, specially about iniciatives and projects that help attract and/or keep and empower girls for STEM areas.
-  I'm also part of a team of girls who develop games - Code Siren :)
-  key interests: Game Dev, HCI & Cybersecurity;
