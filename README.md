- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gwaean, also known as Niki or Nicole
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, books (specially sci-fi and fantasy!), arts & drawing and well... computation I guess lol!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying information systems at UTFPR
- 💞️ You know, I'd love to work at a game studio/company or an animation studio. Maybe developping my own stuff (cofcof games) and who knows where life will lead me?
